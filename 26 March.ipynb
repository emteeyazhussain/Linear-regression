    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between two variables, where one variable is considered as the dependent variable and the other variable is considered as the independent variable. The model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the two variables, and it uses the independent variable to predict the dependent variable. For example, a simple linear regression model can be used to predict the sales of a product based on the price of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multiple linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between more than two variables, where one variable is considered as the dependent variable and the other variables are considered as independent variables. The model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable, and it uses the independent variables to predict the dependent variable. For example, a multiple linear regression model can be used to predict the salary of an employee based on their age, education level, years of experience, and job position."

    "##Q2.\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The assumptions of linear regression are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable is linear. This means that as the independent variable changes, the change in the dependent variable is proportional and constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation does not depend on the value of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variable. This means that the spread of the residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) is the same for all values of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The errors are normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the residuals is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. This means that each independent variable provides unique information to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several diagnostic tests that can be performed. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual plot: Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can show whether the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity hold. If the residuals are randomly scattered around zero, the assumptions are met. If the residuals show a pattern or the spread of the residuals changes across different predicted values, the assumptions are violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal probability plot: Plotting the residuals against a normal distribution can show whether the assumption of normality holds. If the points on the plot fall on a straight line, the assumption is met. If the points deviate from a straight line, the assumption is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance inflation factor (VIF): Calculating the VIF for each independent variable can show whether the assumption of no multicollinearity holds. If the VIF is less than 5, the assumption is met. If the VIF is greater than 5, the assumption is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, checking the assumptions of linear regression is important to ensure that the model is appropriate for the data and that the results are reliable. If the assumptions are violated, it may be necessary to use a different model or transform the data before analysis."

    "##Q3.In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept represent the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. It indicates the direction and magnitude of the relationship between the two variables. If the slope is positive, it means that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable also increases. If the slope is negative, it means that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases. The magnitude of the slope indicates the strength of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable(s) are equal to zero. It is the point where the regression line intersects the y-axis. It provides information about the starting point of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a real-world scenario where we want to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. We can use a simple linear regression model to model this relationship. The regression equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary = Intercept + Slope * Years of Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept represents the starting point of the relationship between salary and years of experience. If the intercept is $40,000, it means that the predicted salary for an employee with zero years of experience is $40,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope represents the change in salary for a one-year increase in years of experience. If the slope is $5,000, it means that the predicted salary increases by $5,000 for every one-year increase in years of experience.\n",

    "##Q4.Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. It is a method of finding the optimal set of parameters (weights and biases) for the model, by iteratively adjusting the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of gradient descent is to start with an initial set of parameters and compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient is a vector that indicates the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent of the cost function. The opposite of the gradient is used to update the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent. This process is repeated iteratively until the cost function reaches a minimum.\n",

    "In batch gradient descent, the entire dataset is used to compute the gradient at each iteration. This method can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, but it often leads to a more accurate and stable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stochastic gradient descent, a random sample (or batch) of the dataset is used to compute the gradient at each iteration. This method is computationally more efficient, but it may lead to a less stable solution due to the noise in the gradient estimates.\n",

    "Gradient descent is used in machine learning to train various types of models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machines. By minimizing the cost function, the model can learn to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

    "##Q6.Multicollinearity is a phenomenon that occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other.
