    "Q1.R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, R² measures how well the linear regression model fits the data. The value of R² ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates that the model explains all of the variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "R² is calculated by taking the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance. The explained variance is the sum of squares of the differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable. The total variance is the sum of squares of the differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the formula for R² is:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",
    "\n",
    "where SSres is the sum of squares of the residuals (the differences between the predicted values and the actual values), and SStot is the total sum of squares (the differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, R² values are interpreted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² = 0: The model does not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "0 < R² < 0.5: The model explains a small amount of the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "0.5 ≤ R² < 0.8: The model explains a moderate amount of the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "R² ≥ 0.8: The model explains a large amount of the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "It's important to note that R² alone cannot determine the validity of a linear regression model. Other statistical measures, such as the p-value and the confidence interval, should also be considered. Additionally, R² should not be used to compare models with different independent variables, as models with more independent variables will generally have higher R² values."

    "Q2.Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in a linear regression model. It is used to provide a more accurate estimate of the model's goodness of fit and to avoid overfitting, which occurs when the model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared = 1 - [(1 - R-squared) * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the sample size and k is the number of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between adjusted R-squared and regular R-squared is that the former penalizes the model for having too many independent variables, while the latter does not. As the number of independent variables in a model increases, the regular R-squared will always increase, even if the additional variables do not improve the model's predictive power. Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, will only increase if the additional variables improve the model's performance beyond what would be expected by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is always lower than regular R-squared, and a higher adjusted R-squared indicates a better model fit. However, it is important to keep in mind that adjusted R-squared is not a perfect measure of model quality and should be used in conjunction with other measures of model performance."

    "-Q3.Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when evaluating the goodness of fit of a linear regression model that contains multiple independent variables. In such cases, regular R-squared may be misleading because it does not take into account the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of independent variables in a model increases, regular R-squared will also increase, even if the additional variables do not actually improve the model's predictive power. This phenomenon is known as overfitting, which occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, provides a more accurate estimate of the model's goodness of fit by penalizing the model for having too many independent variables. The penalty factor is proportional to the number of independent variables, which means that a higher penalty is applied for models with more variables. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not including variables that are not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you are evaluating a linear regression model that contains multiple independent variables, it is recommended to use adjusted R-squared as a measure of the model's goodness of fit rather than regular R-squared.

    "Q6.Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, is a technique used in regression analysis to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function of the regression model.

This is because the linear regression model may capture noise and idiosyncrasies in the training data that are not representative of the population.\n",
