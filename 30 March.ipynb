    "Q1.lastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the L1 and L2 penalties of Lasso and Ridge regression respectively, to overcome their limitations and provide a more stable and accurate regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the objective function includes both L1 and L2 penalties, and it aims to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the predicted values and the actual values, while also constraining the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 penalty) and the sum of the squared values of the coefficients (L2 penalty).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques is the way it handles the multicollinearity issue, which arises when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression may produce unstable and unreliable estimates in the presence of multicollinearity, while Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression can address it to some extent, but each has its own limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression provides a compromise between Ridge and Lasso regression by combining their strengths and minimizing their weaknesses. It can select relevant features and perform variable selection like Lasso, while also handling multicollinearity and maintaining stability in the model like Ridge regression."

    "\n",
    "- Handles Multicollinearity: Elastic Net Regression can handle multicollinearity better than other regression techniques by combining the L1 and L2 penalties of Lasso and Ridge regression respectively. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the model.\n",
