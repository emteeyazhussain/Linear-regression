    "Q1.Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression technique used to perform variable selection and regularization in statistical modeling. It is also known as L1 regularization. The word \"Lasso\" is an acronym for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, subject to a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the independent variables. This constraint forces some of the coefficients to be zero, effectively removing some of the independent variables from the model. This results in a simpler and more interpretable model that can generalize better on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques such as Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares Regression in that it uses L1 regularization instead of L2 regularization. L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which tends to shrink them towards zero, but not necessarily to exactly zero. L1 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients, which has the effect of setting some of them exactly to zero, and thus performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that can perform variable selection and regularization simultaneously by setting some of the coefficients to zero. It differs from other regression techniques in that it uses L1 regularization, which has the effect of performing variable selection more aggressively."

    "Q2.The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to perform both feature selection and regularization simultaneously. Lasso Regression can effectively shrink the coefficients of the features that are less relevant to the dependent variable to zero, effectively removing them from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to automatically perform feature selection leads to a simpler and more interpretable model, and can also improve the model's performance by reducing overfitting, which can occur when too many features are included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other feature selection methods, such as backward or forward selection, Lasso Regression can handle situations where there are a large number of features or where the features are highly correlated with each other. In such cases, other feature selection methods may be less effective or may require more computational resources.\n",

    "Q3.In Lasso Regression, the coefficients represent the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, after accounting for the effects of all the other independent variables in the model. The coefficients can be interpreted in the same way as in a standard linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because Lasso Regression can set some of the coefficients to exactly zero, interpreting the coefficients can be slightly different than in a standard linear regression model. If a coefficient is exactly zero, it means that the corresponding independent variable has been completely excluded from the model and has no effect on the dependent variable. On the other hand, if a coefficient is non-zero, it means that the corresponding independent variable has a non-zero effect on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model, it's important to keep in mind that the variables with non-zero coefficients have a significant effect on the dependent variable, while variables with zero coefficients have been effectively excluded from the model. Additionally, the size of the coefficients can be used to determine the strength and direction of the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the interpretation of the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model is similar to that in a standard linear regression model, but with the added consideration of which variables have been excluded from the model due to their coefficients being exactly zero.\n",

    "Q4.Lasso Regression has a single tuning parameter, called the regularization parameter, denoted by λ (lambda). This parameter controls the strength of the L1 penalty term that is added to the regression objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of λ determines the extent to which the coefficients are penalized for being too large, and therefore the extent to which the model performs regularization. A smaller value of λ corresponds to less regularization, which means the model will fit the training data more closely and potentially overfit. On the other hand, a larger value of λ corresponds to more regularization, which means the model will be more biased and may underfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to determine the optimal value of λ is to perform cross-validation. This involves splitting the data into multiple folds, and using each fold as a validation set while the remaining folds are used to train the model. The performance of the model on the validation set is then used to select the optimal value of λ that minimizes the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regularization parameter, other tuning parameters may be used in conjunction with Lasso Regression, such as the method used to optimize the objective function (e.g., coordinate descent, proximal gradient descent), or the tolerance level used to terminate the optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter λ, which controls the strength of the L1 penalty term and the extent to which the model performs regularization. The value of λ should be chosen to balance between bias and variance, and can be determined through cross-validation. Other tuning parameters may also be used to optimize the model's performance."

    "Q5.Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique and is designed to model linear relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables. However, it is possible to use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems by transforming the independent variables into non-linear functions of themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by applying non-linear transformations such as logarithmic, exponential, or polynomial functions to the independent variables. The transformed variables can then be used as inputs to the Lasso Regression model, which will still perform variable selection and regularization, but with the transformed variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a non-linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable x, we can transform x into a polynomial function of degree n, such as x², x³, etc. This will create new variables that capture the non-linear relationship between x and the dependent variable. We can then apply Lasso Regression on these transformed variables to select the most relevant variables and estimate their coefficients.\n",

    "It is important to note that when using Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems, the choice of transformation function and degree can have a significant impact on the model's performance.

The optimal value of lambda is the one that minimizes the information criterion.\n",
